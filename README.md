# Operating Systems (Spr2020) Project 1
This project is composed of two files:
  1. system_call.c
  2. context_switch.c

The first file measures the time-cost of calling 'getpid()' on Linux. The second file measures the time-cost of a context switch on Linux.

To compile and execute:
 -make            Compiles both files
 -make runsc      Compiles and executes system_call.c
 -make runcs      Compiles and executes context_switch.c
 -make clean      Removes object files, and other files generated by compilation.
