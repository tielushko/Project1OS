# Operating Systems (Spr2020) Project 1
This project is composed of two files:
  1. system_call.c
  2. context_switch.c

The first file measures the time-cost of calling 'getpid()' on Linux. The second file measures the time-cost of a context switch on Linux.

To compile and execute:
 1. -make            (Compiles both files)
 2. -make runsc      (Compiles and executes system_call.c)
 3. -make runcs      (Compiles and executes context_switch.c)
 4. -make clean      (Removes object files, and other files generated by compilation.)
